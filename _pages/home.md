## Welcome

I am a PhD student in the **Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan**.  
I hold a **B.Sc. (Hons) in Statistics** from *St. Xavier’s College, Kolkata* and an **M.Stat.** from the *Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata*.

My research is in **statistical genetics**, with a focus on developing **statistical methods for gene-level inference and causal gene prioritization** in human genetic studies. I am also broadly interested in **applied statistical modeling, clinical trial design and analysis, and machine learning**, with an emphasis on principled inference and real-world data applications.

### Research Interests
- Statistical genetics  
- Gene-level and variant-level association testing  
- Causal gene prioritization  
- Integration of GWAS and molecular QTL data  
- High-dimensional statistical methods
- Multiple hypothesis testing
- Clinical trial design and analysis
- Machine learning

### Current Work
My current research focuses on:
- Comparing aggregation tests with single-variant approaches  
- Developing statistical frameworks for integrating GWAS, QTLs, and gene-level features  
- Comparing aggregation tests with sequencing data versus array+imputed data
